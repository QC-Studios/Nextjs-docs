## 💡 What is This Documentation?

This documentation is a **complete guide to Next.js 15 (App Router)**, written in a **practical, example-driven** format.
Each topic explains how a particular feature works, followed by **real code samples** and **Postman or UI-based examples**, so you can directly apply it in your own projects.

The goal is simple — to make you confident in building **production-level Next.js apps** by understanding *why* and *how* things work.

## 🚀 Why This Docs?

While most tutorials explain theory, this documentation focuses on:

* ✅ **Real-world implementation** with code
* ✅ **Simplified explanations** (Hindi + English mix)
* ✅ **Consistent structure** for every topic
* ✅ **Progressive learning flow** — from basics to advanced

You won’t just copy-paste — you’ll understand every line.

## 🧭 What You’ll Learn

This series walks you through everything in Next.js 15, including:

* **Routing System**

  * Route Handlers, Middleware, Cookies, and Redirects
* **Rendering Methods**

  * Static, Dynamic, Streaming, Server-Side, and Edge Rendering
* **Data Handling**

  * Server & Client Data Fetching, Sequential & Parallel Fetching
* **Component Logic**

  * Server & Client Components, Context Providers, Client-Only, Server-Only Components
* **Advanced Topics**

  * Partial Prerendering, Server Actions, and more

Every section builds naturally on top of the previous one — so if you read it in order, it’ll feel like a journey from *beginner → expert*.

## 🧩 How to Use This Documentation

Here’s how you can make the best use of this guide:

1. **Start from the top** — Each topic depends slightly on the previous one.
2. **Run the examples** — Most sections have full working code snippets (like `route.ts` examples).
3. **Experiment in Postman or your browser** — Many examples use real API testing methods.
4. **Observe patterns** — Once you finish Routing, move to Rendering → Data Fetching → Server Actions, in that order.
5. **Bookmark sections** — Use them as a ready reference while coding.
